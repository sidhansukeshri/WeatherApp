# Weather App

Welcome to my Weather App repository! This simple web application lets you check the weather conditions for any city around the world.

## Overview

The Weather App is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to provide real-time weather data. It's a fun project that I created to practice my front-end web development skills.

## Features

- **Weather Data**: Get real-time weather information, including temperature, weather condition, humidity, wind speed, and visibility.
- **Background Images**: Enjoy dynamic background images that change based on the current weather conditions.
- **Unit Conversion**: Easily switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit units.
- **Error Handling**: If you enter an invalid city name, the app will gracefully handle the error.

## How to Use

1. Simply enter the name of the city you want to check the weather for in the input field.
2. Choose whether you want the temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit by selecting the appropriate radio button.
3. Click the "Search" button, and voil√†! You'll see the weather information for your chosen city.

Enjoy checking the weather with my Weather App! If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out. Happy coding!
